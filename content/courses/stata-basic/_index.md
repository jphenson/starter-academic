## Introduction
This online course is adapted from course I taught for the Research Excellence in Economics Program (RE2P) at Georgia State University. This course is the first in a series of Stata courses on the website. I know many people will ask the question, "Why Stata when I could use Python, R, etc. ?" Well, the short answer is a lot of economists(especially Microeconomics and Econometrics) write new programs and functions in Stata, and if you want to be able to use these new methods, you will need to learn Stata. Additionally, your advisors, professors, or teachers likely use Stata most often, and if you want to work with them and write papers, then you will learn Stata to make life easier. Those are not the only reasons as American University has a detailed explanation of [why you should learn Stata][1].

In learning to use Stata, it should be treated as if you are learning a new language. The quickest learning method is repeatedly using Stata and typing up new programs. It is not sufficient to just read about the procedures. The code and results from this course are available.
